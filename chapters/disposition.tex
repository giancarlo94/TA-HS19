\chapter{Disposition}
\label{chp:disposition}

In these few subsections I will lay out what the context, the goal and the methods of this term paper.

\subsection{Summary of the subject}
Reranking and the use of genetic algorithms are two popular approaches when it comes to implementing recommender systems. In recent articles these approaches perform well but show some limitations in regard to the size of the training data sets and the duration oft he training itself. The goal of this term paper is to find these limits. A comparison between the two approaches and baseline algorithms (for example matrix factorization or collaborative filtering) will help determine the usefulness of the approaches in question.
